# Adding copy feature to footnote

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to offer a feature that allows users to copy contents of footnotes. Some of the times footnotes provide a synonym to the word and user gets confused about the meaning of it so this feature would help users to copy and search for meaning of the word.
The key design decision we need to make here is where to provide the copy button and how should we design it.

## Considered Options

- Provide a button button saying copy
- Copy to clipboard button

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Provide copy button

- Good, because it's easy for the user to understand how to use it
- Bad, takes a lot of space of the footnote which can be used for different options.

### Copy to clipboard button

- Good, as it is a small button which can be clicked and copy pasted.
- Bad, some of the user would not understand how to use it.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "provide a button saying copy", prioritizing simplicity and clarity in the code will ultimately save time and effort in the long run.
